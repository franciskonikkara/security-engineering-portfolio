## 🛠️ Projects

### 1️⃣ Secure CI/CD Pipeline (FedRAMP-Aligned DevSecOps)
Designed and enforced a compliance-ready CI/CD pipeline with embedded SAST, secrets scanning, and container vulnerability gates, producing audit-grade evidence aligned to SOC 2 and ISO/IEC 27001 controls.
**Focus:** SAST, Container Scanning, Policy-as-Code, Audit Evidence
